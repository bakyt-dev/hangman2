# DETAILED DEVELOPMENT && LEARNING PROGRESS

## Hangman
1. This is my second attempt to build a first project from the Sergei Zhukov's Java Roadmap - https://zhukovsd.github.io/java-backend-learning-course/projects/hangman/
2. Even though the project is very basic I have faced difficulties from the beginnig as I have zero coding experience.

### Note #1
The very first Hangman project I built basicly by using the _Claude_ (which generated 99% of the code base).
Since I grasp new things from the "top to down" ("general to specific") the goal was to understand a big picture of the project through analizing Java program flow (what's going on after clicking _Run_ on IDE) and class design, methods, variables etc. 

The big problem: decomposition 
What's done:
- watched: OOP decomposition of the game "Four in a row" from the TG community chanel
- watched: https://www.youtube.com/live/3ox5DI_xAog
- read: Java program flow, Java Terminology: Properties vs Values vs Variables vs Fields vs Attributes, Guide to Object-Oriented Relationships, Java Class Organization Standards
